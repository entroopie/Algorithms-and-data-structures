# Algorithms-and-data-structures
Simple algorithms and data structures implemented during laboratory classes.

# Hash table
Count the number of occurences of each word in the text given in the input. Store these numbers in a hash table: the word should be interpreted as a key (type string), and the number of occurences as a value (type int). Use the "chaining" method of collision resolving.

Input
The text (any number of words with only lower case letters, separated by spaces or new line characters). The words starting with character '?' and '-', and the word 'q' should be interpreted as commands:
- '?' - print the number of occurences of the given word on the screen,
- '-' - remove the information about the given word from your hash table (from this point you should start counting the occurences of this word from 0),
- 'q' - exit.

# Heap
Implement a max/min heap and the following operations:
- '+ v' - add a number v to the heap
- '-' - remove the maximum from the max heap (minimum from the min heap respectively) and write it on the screen
- 'p' - write all elements of the heap in the order in which they are stored in an array
- 'r n v1 ...vn' - remove all elements from the heap and create a heap out of n new elements, of the values given by v1 ...vn
- 's' - change the orientation of the heap â€“ from max to min or from min to max; s operation can be requested multiple times
- 'q' - exit the program

Additional remarks:
Operation 'r' is not the same as a sequence of '+' operations.
If both children are equal the child of the lesser index is swapped.
Using the std::vector class is forbidden.

# BST
Implement a binary search tree (BST). Each element of a tree should have a key (unsigned integer).

Your program should support the following operations:
- '+' - add a new element with a given key to the tree,
- '-' - remove an element with a given key from the tree (ignore this operation if there is no such an element in the tree),
- '?' - search the tree for an element with a given key, write '1' if the element was found, or '0' if not,
- 'm' - write the key of the minimum element in the tree,
- 'M' - write the key of the maximum element in the tree,
- 'q' - quit the program.

# Linked list FIFO
Implement a linked list. Every element of the list should contain a key of type int (signed integer), and some pointers that are required by your linked list implementation.

Your program should support the following operations:
- 'i' - insert a new element to the end of your list,
- 'd' - delete an element from the beginning of your list,
- 's' - search for an element of the list with a given key, and return its index or -1 if the element was not found (if there are multiple elements with the same key, the smallest of the indices should be returned),
- 'q' - deallocate memory and quit the program.

The first element (head) of your list should be interpreted as an element on position 0, the second element is on position 1, etc.
